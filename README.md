I recently build this simple construction to press threaded inserts into 3D printed parts with the help of an old soldering iron. I have replaced the original soldering iron tip with some self made insert tips out of stainless steel which are made on a lathe (unfortunately not by myself). Nevertheless it works with the original soldering tip as well.

Don't forget the fan, because the soldering iron is not made to be used in vertical direction and the heat may destroy the plastic above the soldering iron tip.

For the complete build you have to print the following:
- 2x slider_mount.stl
- 2x rail_mount.stl
- 2x adjustment_screw.stl
- 1x solderingiron_mount.stl
- 1x fan_mount.stl
- 1x cable_box.stl (optional)
- 100x testboard.stl (:D)

It is a simple straight forward construction. For those of you who gonna build it, I have uploaded a few pictures of the main components. If you still have questions then feel free to ask!

Have fun! :)
